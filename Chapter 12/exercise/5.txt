Q. Suppose that a is a one-dimensional array and p is a pointer variable. 
Assuming that the assignment p = a has just been performed, which of the following expressions are illegal
because of mismatched types? Of the remaining expressions, which are true (have a nonzero value)?

(a) p == a[0]
(b) p == &a[0]
(c) *p == a[0]
(d) p[0] == a[0]

A. 

(a) illegal
p는 int *, a[0]은 int이므로 자료형이 맞지 않는다. 

(b) legal, true
(c) legal, true
(d) legal, true
